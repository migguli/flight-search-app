# SkyScanner API Integration To-Do List

## 1. API Setup
- [ ] Register for a SkyScanner API key at the [SkyScanner developer portal](https://www.partners.skyscanner.net/)
- [ ] Set up environment variables to store API keys securely
- [ ] Add SkyScanner API key to `.env` file and `.env.example` template
- [ ] Configure API request rate limiting and error handling

## 2. API Client Implementation
- [ ] Create an API client service for making SkyScanner API requests
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic for API calls
- [ ] Set up TypeScript interfaces for SkyScanner API response types
- [ ] Create utility functions for parsing API responses

## 3. Flight Search Functionality
- [ ] Implement flights search functionality using the `/flights/search` endpoint
- [ ] Create functions for one-way flight search
- [ ] Create functions for multi-city flight search
- [ ] Implement location detection using Browser Location API
- [ ] Create mock data for Airbnb host cities

## 4. Search Result Processing
- [ ] Develop functions to parse and format flight search results
- [ ] Implement sorting logic for flight results (price, duration, departure time)
- [ ] Build filtering capabilities for search results
- [ ] Design caching strategy to reduce API calls

## 5. UI Components
- [ ] Create flight search form components
- [ ] Build date picker with fixed and flexible date options
- [ ] Develop flight results display components
- [ ] Create loading states and error handling UI

## 6. State Management
- [ ] Set up state management for search parameters
- [ ] Implement persistent state for search history
- [ ] Create context or store for managing flight search results

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for API client functions
- [ ] Create integration tests for search functionality
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for the search flow
- [ ] Set up mocks for API responses during testing

## 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement request caching to minimize API calls
- [ ] Add pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Optimize bundle size for API client
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for flight results

## 9. Documentation
- [ ] Document API integration approach
- [ ] Create usage examples for the API client
- [ ] Document types and interfaces
- [ ] Add comments to complex functions

## 10. Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Set up monitoring for API call success/failure rates
- [ ] Implement logging for API request/response cycles
- [ ] Configure alerts for API quotas and rate limits
- [ ] Test API integration in staging environment before production release
