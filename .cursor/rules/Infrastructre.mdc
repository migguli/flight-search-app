Always use aws with terraform and opentofu.
Use remote state in s3 bucket.
We are using asdf.
If aws iam credentials do not have needed access rights, do not try to circumvent that. Ask for more access rights. 
Check [combined-policy.json](mdc:terraform/combined-policy.json) file for what rights you have, and make changes there if needed. Ask developer to update policy manually.
